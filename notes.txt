- access modifiers -
public - visible outside a contract
internal - visible to a contract and those that extend it
private - visible to only the contract that defines it

libraries are 'attached' to contracts

- checked number -> not allowed to wrap around to zero when max limit is exceeded
- unchecked -> wraps around to zero when max number limit is reached
to perform an unchecked operation, do: unchecked {<operation>}
- unchecked is used in solidity 0.8 and above to save on gas used in checking

-- tricks for reducing gas --
-> use constant and immutable variables
-> use custom errors, revert and if statements instead of require

-> special functions like callback, receive and constructor don't have the function
 keyword preceding them
